This repo contains my course project to Coursera "Getting And Cleaning Data" course that is part of Data Science specialization.

There is just one script called run_analysis.R. It contains all functions and code to do the following:

Download UCI HAR zip file to data dir
Read data
Do some transformations
Write output data to a CSV file inside data/output dir
The CodeBook.md explains it more detailed.
